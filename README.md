# Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) Prediction Project

The purpose of the project is to build a prediction tool that estimates the possibility of nuclear localization signals inside a protein's sequence while also taking into account its 3-D structure to help assess whether or not certain amino acids factor into forming one of these signals or not. In addition to the 3-D structure, the position of each amino acid inside the sequence is also taken into consideration.
